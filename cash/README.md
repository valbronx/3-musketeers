What is Cash:
Cash is a small library for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer 9+) that provides jQuery style syntax for manipulating the DOM. Utilizing modern browser features to minimize the codebase, developers can use the familiar chainable methods at a fraction of the file size. 100% feature parity with jQuery isn't a goal, but cash comes helpfully close, covering most day to day use cases.

Installation : 
Cash can be installed through NPM as the cash-dom package:
npm install cash-dom --save-dev
